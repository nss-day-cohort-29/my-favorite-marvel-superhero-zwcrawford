    <p>The question is: Why isn't Silver Surfer everyone's favorite comic book superhero? The Silver Surfer 
    is a humanoid with metallic skin who can travel through space with the aid of his surfboard-like 
    craft. Originally a young astronomer named Norrin Radd on the planet Zenn-La, he saved his 
    homeworld from the planet devourer, Galactus, by serving as his herald. Imbued in return with a 
    tiny portion of Galactus's Power Cosmic,[4] Radd acquired vast power, a new body and a surfboard-like 
    craft on which he could travel faster than light. Now known as the Silver Surfer, Radd roamed the 
    cosmos searching for planets for Galactus to consume. When his travels took him to Earth, he met 
    the Fantastic Four, who helped him rediscover his humanity and nobility of spirit. Betraying Galactus, 
    the Surfer saved Earth but was exiled there as punishment.</p>
